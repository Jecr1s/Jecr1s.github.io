# **No. 3: Sun Tzu - Tactical Genius**

Sun Tzu is one of the best Epic Rarity Commander in the game. 

He deals decent damage and gives a decent defense for your 

troops to stay alive longer. A maxed out Sun Tzu can give you

additional damage to enemies, more targets hit, and increased active

skill damage. This is one of the commanders you want to max out first.



# **No. 2: Minamoto no Yoshitsune - Kamakura's Warlord**

Minamoto no Yoshitsune is a good Legendary Commander for peacekeeping

and rallying barbarian forts. He deals massive amount of damage to 

enemies if expertised. He is a single target commander so he only

deals damage to one army at a time. It is best to use him in 1v1

open fields to avoid having expensive hospital bills.

# **No. 1: Yi Seong-Gye - Bow of Revolution**

![Yi_Seong-Gye](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102574739/162381574-8c453a69-b94c-4dc3-a1b7-da6d7b9d193f.png)

Yi Seong-Gye can be obtained in Wheel of Fortune event. 

He deals massive amount of damage to up to 5 enemies.

If maxed out, his Area of Effect damage now hits in a 

circular area, meaning more enemies can be hit. He can

also be used in barb chaining. A technic to save Action Points

in killing barbarians. his damage is quite heavy and

destructive that they will target him to reduce your damage.

While in open field, you can choose to either make him 

a secondary commander or a primary commander.
