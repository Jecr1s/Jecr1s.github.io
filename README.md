Sun Tzu is one of the best Epic Rarity Commander in the game. He deals decent damage
and gives a decent defense for your troops to stay alive longer. A maxed out Sun Tzu 
can give you additional damage to enemies, more targets hit, and increased active
skill damage. This is one of the commanders you want to max out first
